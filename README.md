# PayPal SDK 2.0.0-beta [![Integratio Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK.svg?branch=2.0-travis)](https://travis-ci.org/paypal/PayPal-NET-SDK)

This is a preview of how PayPal SDKs will look in the next major version. We've simplified the interface to only provide HTTPRequest that can easily be called via our HttpClient. This SDK is fully dotnet core 2.0 compatible. 

### Creating a Payment

```cs
using System.Linq;
using PayPal.Core;
using PayPal.Payment;

var environment = new SandboxEnvironment("AdV4d6nLHabWLyemrw4BKdO9LjcnioNIOgoz7vD611ObbDUL0kJQfzrdhXEBwnH8QmV-7XZjvjRWn0kg", "EPKoPC_haZMTq5uM9WXuzoxUVdgzVqHyD5avCyVC1NCIUJeVaNNUZMnzduYIqrdw-carG9LBAizFGMyK");
var client = new PayPalHttpClient(environment);

var payment = new Payment()
            {
                Intent = intent,
                Transactions = new List<Transaction>() 
                {
                    new Transaction()
                    {
                        Amount = new Amount()
                        {
                            Total = "10",
                            Currency = "USD"
                        }
                    }
                },
                RedirectUrls = new RedirectUrls() 
                {
                    CancelUrl = "http://paypal.com/cancel",
                    ReturnUrl = "http://paypal.com/return"
                }
                Payer = new Payer() 
                {
                    PaymentMethod = "paypal"
                }
            };

PaymentCreateRequest request = new PaymentCreateRequest();
request.RequestBody(payment);

try 
{
  HttpResponse response = await client().Execute(request);
  var statusCode = response.StatusCode;
  Payment result = response.Result<Payment>();
} 
catch(HttpException httpException) 
{
  var statusCode = httpException.StatusCode;
  var debugId = httpException.Headers.GetValues("PayPal-Debug-Id").FirstOrDefault();
}
```
